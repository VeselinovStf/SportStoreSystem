# SportStoreSystem
Demo project exercise based on [Pro ASP NET CORE MVC Book](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484231494)
--------------------------------------
Create an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, 
a shopping cart where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter 
their shipping details. I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, 
update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for managing the catalog and only logged-in administrators can make changes. 
--------------------------------------
Improvements beyond book
1. Separating application architecture in layers
	- Data / Data
	- Models / Data
	- Services / Business
	- Web / Presentation
	- Tests
2. The Card Items Are stored in DB and use separate models for Item And Card itself
